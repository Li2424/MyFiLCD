# MyFiLCD
This is a simple and fun arduino project for beginners. You can display a text on a display over WiFi using the abillities of the Arduino WiFi Rev2 board.
To run this code, you'll need to install all required libraries and have the correct hardware and circuit set up.
For a complete tutorial about the setup, take a look at the project on my webpage.
